# Solid-Lite: Social Lined Data Made Easy

## **Motivation**

Solid, from its inception, has held a vision of decentralization, giving individuals control of their data. However, for a truly broad implementation of this vision, we need a protocol that speaks to every developer â€“ from the hobbyist working from their bedroom to the professional building enterprise applications.

**Solid-Lite** is born from this need. It aims to keep true to Solid's original vision while ensuring that the protocol remains accessible and flexible.

### **Our Goals**:

1. **Broad Implementation**: We aim for wide adoption, across multiple platforms and domains.
2. **Test Suite Comparability**: Ensuring consistency across implementations.
3. **Easy Server Implementation**: Straightforward and simple server creation and setup process.
4. **Useful Apps**: Supporting a range of applications that users find valuable.
5. **Bug-Free Servers**: Stability and reliability as core principles.
6. **True to Solid's Original Vision**: Upholding the principles of user control and decentralization.
7. **Upgrade Path to the Big Solid Spec**: A clear and manageable migration process.
8. **Allow Experimental Options**: A platform that supports innovation and experimentation.
9. **Interest to More Casual Developers**: Making Solid-Lite approachable to all.
10. **Diverse Participation**: Encouraging contributions from all backgrounds and experiences.
11. **Shallow Learning Curve**: An easily understandable and learnable protocol.

## **Possible Use Cases**:

1. **Personal Data Lockers**: Individuals can store their data securely, with granular control over who can access it.
2. **Collaborative Platforms**: Whether for businesses or personal projects, teams can work together without compromising data control.
3. **Educational Portfolios**: Students and educators can manage academic records, projects, and feedback.
4. **Health Data Management**: Patients can have control over their medical data, sharing it only with who they choose.
5. **E-Commerce Platforms**: Vendors can maintain product inventories and customer data without relying on third-party platforms that might misuse customer information.
6. **Media Libraries**: Artists and creators can store their work, from music tracks to digital artworks, with full control over their distribution and sharing permissions.
7. **Scientific Data Management**: Researchers can store, share, or keep their data private, facilitating collaborative studies or individual research projects.
8. **Public Service Applications**: Governments and public service entities can offer citizen-centric applications, empowering individuals to manage their interaction and data with public bodies.

## **In Conclusion**

Solid-Lite is not just a protocol; it's a revolution. It represents the bridge between the foundational principles of Solid and the broader developer community, making the decentralized web more accessible than ever.

By simplifying, streamlining, and staying true to the ethos of user empowerment, Solid-Lite has the potential to become the backbone of the next generation of web applications. Through its implementation, we can look forward to a web that respects individual privacy, promotes collaboration, and fosters innovation.

Join us on this journey. Together, let's reshape the future of the web.
